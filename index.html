    <p>
        Hi! I'm Kayleigh, a BSc Computing and IT student at The Open University, nearing the completion of my degree. Originally
        from the beautiful Isle of Islay, Scotland, I am currently based in Glasgow. With a passion for creating intuitive and
        visually appealing web interfaces, I aspire to start my career as a front-end web developer. My education has equipped
        me with strong technical skills and a solid understanding of modern technologies. I'm excited to bring my creativity
        and problem-solving abilities to the tech industry, crafting seamless digital experiences for users.
